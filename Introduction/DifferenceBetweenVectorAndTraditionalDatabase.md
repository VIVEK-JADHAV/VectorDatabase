# How Vector Databases Differ from Traditional Databases

## Traditional Databases: Structured and Transaction-Oriented

To understand the distinct advantages of vector databases, it helps to begin with a brief overview of traditional databases, particularly the relational model. Traditional databases store data in a structured format using rows and columns. This design supports logical data retrieval and analysis.

One of their defining strengths is adherence to ACID properties—Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure transactional integrity, meaning that even in the event of errors or failures, data remains accurate and consistent. This makes traditional databases ideal for use cases where data integrity is critical, such as financial systems, enterprise applications, and detailed reporting environments.

However, this robustness comes with certain limitations. Traditional databases enforce a rigid schema, requiring that all data conform to predefined columns and data types. As a result, they struggle to accommodate the explosion of complex and unstructured data that is increasingly common today.

## Vector Databases: Designed for Complex and Unstructured Data

In contrast, vector databases take a completely different approach to structuring data. Rather than relying on rows and columns, they represent data as mathematical vectors in a high-dimensional vector space. This allows them to store and process complex data types like images, text, and user embeddings—types of data that
